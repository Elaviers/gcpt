Gamma Cagadota Puyo Tetris (gcpt)
Still super unfinished. I flattened all of ELLib and used that codebase as a baseline for this project.
I've set up a lot of the basics (net, soundconfig, kickset, rendering..), but it's got a way to go. super WIP.

Man, it's a good thing PHANTOMEX2011 is going to do all the work with his c++ expertise!

To build: run thirdparty/BuildDeps_Win.bat, then /GCPT_Windows.bat
